For the *Mobile Sports & Health-care* course we developed an online medication systems which enables doctors to set-up medication plans for his patients. Patients can use an Android app to retrieve the medication plans and get informed about intake times. Whenever the doctor modifies a medication plan the patient gets notified by the app. The doctor can also set-up templates for common diseases like the flu. Our motivation was to decrease the number of false intakes.
